        %strong Use of Services
        %p
          Zapfolio grants you permission to make use of our severs and website administration services ("Services"), provided that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not barred from receiving such services under the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions. You agree to immediately notify Zapfolio of any unauthorized use of your account or other breach of security. Zapfolio will not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from your failure to keep your account secure.

      %li
        %strong Acceptable Conduct and Account Access
        %p
          You agree that any usage of your account deemed as unacceptable by Zapfolio will result in immediate account suspension or cancellation without a refund and the possibility that Zapfolio will impose fees and/or pursue civil action to recover compensation for damages without any prior notice.

          Zapfolio and its Services may not be used for any unlawful purpose. Transmission or storage of any material in violation of United States or state law is considered prohibited, and may be grounds for immediate account termination. This includes materials protected by intellectual property rights or materials deemed illegal for possession or distribution.

          Additionally, providing false data on any subscription, including the use of unauthorized credit card or other payment information shall result in immediate account termination, and will be reported to law enforcement authorities.

          Zapfolio reserves the right to suspend access to any customer if, in the judgment of the Zapfolio administrators, the customer’s account is the cause of a violation of any of the other terms of service or for any other reason which Zapfolio chooses. Zapfolio will make a reasonable and good-faith effort to notify the Customer prior to unilateral cancellation in order to resolve any problem or dispute with a minimum of service interruption, save in cases otherwise excepted.

        %strong Payment and Subscriptions
        %p
          You agree that Zapfolio shall be permitted to charge your credit card on a recurring basis, as agreed upon in advance of providing services. Payment is due upon issuance of invoice. Your service or access may be interrupted and/or cancelled for accounts that are seven days or more past due.

          Zapfolio shall not be held responsible for any additional fees or charges resulting from charges billed by Zapfolio, such as overdraft fees or finance charges.

          Zapfolio provides a 99.9% uptime guarantee on all portfolio sites. If in any billing period, your portfolio site is not accessible for more than 0.1% of the billing period, you may request a pro-rated credit for the down-time.

          If at any time it becomes necessary for Zapfolio to cancel Customer’s service without cause, Zapfolio will provide 30 days advance notice by way of contact information furnished to Zapfolio by Customer. In the event that Customer’s service is cancelled without cause, Zapfolio will refund a pro-rated portion of the Customer’s last payment.

          Customer may cancel any individual subscription at any time by using the “Cancel Subscription” button located on the billing page. Once a subscription is canceled, the account will remain active until the end of the billing period, and then immediately deactivated. Refunds will not be issued for time remaining in the billing period. Cancellation of service does not relieve Customer of responsibility for the payment of any accrued charges.

          If Customer modifies a subscription’s term, that term change will take effect at the beginning of the next billing cycle. For example, if Customer holds a current one-year subscription, and downgrades it to a three-month subscription, then the subscription will renew for three months once the one-year subscription expires.

        %strong Limitation of Liability
        %p
          The Customer acknowledges that the service provided is of such a nature that service can be interrupted for many reasons other than the negligence of Zapfolio. As a result, subscriber agrees that Zapfolio shall not be held responsible or liable for any damages resultant from any cause beyond the direct and exclusive control of Zapfolio. Customer further acknowledges that Zapfolio’s liability for its own negligence shall not exceed an amount equivalent to charges payable by Customer for services during the billing period damages occurred. Zapfolio shall not be held responsible or liable for any consequential damages, loss or injury.
